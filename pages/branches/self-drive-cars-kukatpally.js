        <p>Driving comfort is tremendously important to remain safe while you are self driving on the road. So at the planning stage itself, when you are considering the type of vehicle to self drive, ask yourself honestly whether it would be comfortable to drive? Also, does it have the necessary space and features for your particular journey - especially if it is an outstation trip or a long one. Of course, for the best self drive cars near Kukatpally, you need not have second thoughts, just go to Long Drive Cars!</p>
        <p className='py-1 lg:py-1'>Coming back to the discussion, remember that driving long distances can be tedious and when you are very tired it can be life-threatening, more so if you’re not used to driving at night. Watch out for state highways, and most Indian roads outside of state capitals are narrow, undivided, not so well maintained asphalt roads. These rural roads in remote areas of almost every state have single lane space, each way. These are chiefly long, flat roads but in some areas they are winding and sometimes abruptly steep. So keeping these factors in mind when planning your self driving trip, maintain a speed you are comfortable in handling. Needless to say that if you are traveling a short distance, then you need not be particular about car features. However, if you are going to self drive for many hours then it's recommended that you rent a vehicle with features/conveniences like more legroom space, strong air conditioning and vital safety features like extra airbags and so on</p>
        <p>Continuing on, if you are merely looking to save money on car hire and fuel, then you will naturally want to self drive the smallest available car. This is okay for those shorter trips within the city, but the car model and its size has certain safety issues when you are going to spend long hours self driving. When in an impact with another car of differing size, it’s almost always that the bigger car is the safest. So do keep this aspect in consideration.</p>
        <p>If you are touring with more people - your family (and importantly, if elderly and young children are onboard), you certainly would want to book a sizable sedan or SUV (sport utility vehicle). In this scenario, opt for a model with ample bottle & cup holders space. Flexible back seats too would come handy when the elderly and kids want to relax after getting tired. Also consider a car model with movie streaming and robust audio system for much needed entertainment.</p>

        <p>Alone, with a companion, or travelling in a group, spending long hours in a car requires comfortable and smart interiors that ensure a comfortable ambience inside.
