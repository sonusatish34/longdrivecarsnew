So while you can search for more places (no need of searching for best self driving cars in Madhapur as you might have already experienced Long Drive Cars advantages), do think of Warangal.</p>
        <p className='text-lg font-bold py-2 lg:py-4'>Visit Warangal through best self driving cars from Madhapur</p>
        <p>Imagine the glory of Kakatiya dynasty. The thousand pillars temple. The Ramappa temple. And your heart would naturally vouch for the majestic aura of Warangal. So take 2 days leave, or choose a weekend, and head straight to Long Drive Cars to choose your kind of car model. Next, self drive straight to Warangal, which is just about 150 km from Hyderabad.</p>
        <p>Once the capital city of famous Kakatiya dynasty, Warangal, once boasted of the massive fort, which is now in ruins, yet displays glory of the past. The famed Kakatiyan arch has been officially embedded into the emblem of newly formed Telangana after the Andhrapradesh state's bifurcation on June 2,2014. Warangal fort has four ornamental gates, referred to as Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, that actually formed the entrances to a now ruined Shiva temple.</p>
        <p>Self drive straight to Thousand pillars temple next, located near the Hanamkonda -Warangal Highway. Built under the rule of king Rudra Deva of Kakatiya empire, the marvelous architecture of this temple stands testimony to splendour of those times.You can miss a mega monolith Nandi, made up of black basalt stone. The intricately carved pillars leave all tourists in awe. There are many fine aspects that words can't describe and so you should discover on your own.</p>
        <p>Feel like going green, self drive to a destination like no other, Lakhnavaram Lake. Lushly located in Govindaraopet Mandal about 70 kilometers away from Warangal city, Lakhnavaram Lake is a popular picnic spot and an exceptional place full of beautiful surroundings. Naturally formed by the presence of three narrow valleys, with each valley replaced with a short bund, and hills acting as natural barriers, the lake is a sight to behold. It has been constructed under the rule pof the Kakatiya dynasty in 13th Century A.D. Self drive is the best option againn as the Lakhnavaram Lake is set in a secluded setting which makes your trip to this place very private.</p>
        <p>Have time to look around? Find an entire expanse glowing with green crops and fresh, placid water bodies. Another breathtaking attraction is the suspension bridge, which takes you to the small island in the lake. For once you need to leave behind your Long Drive Cars to avail the boat riding facility in order to visit the most serene sections of the picturesque lake.</p>
        <p>The next must visit place is Ramappa Temple, an ancient temple situated at Palampet village of Warangal. Also famous as Ramalingeswara Temple or Rudreshwara Temple, it is dedicated to Lord Shiva and was built during the rule of Kakatiya king Ganapati Deva. One of the top heritage sites in India and among the must visit places in Warangal tour, it is known for its grand architecture and subtle carvings.</p>
        <p>While the temple has been on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site under ‘The Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways’, since 2014, the good news is that it has been conferred with World Heritage Site status on 25th July 2021, making it the 39th World Heritage Site of India. An interesting fact: while generally the temples in India are named after the presiding deity of the temple, Ramalingeswara Temple is one of its kind rare temples in the world named and probably the only temple in India to be referred by the name of its sculptor.</p>
        <p>While you are here, self drive to another gem nearby: Ramappa Lake. Carved under the patronage of Ganapathi Deva, the Kakatiyan ruler in 13 century - Ramappa Lake is said to be spread across an area of 82 Sq km. It is surrounded with exquisite hillocks standing on top of which you can gain impressive views of landscape around. However, the best time to view is ideally during the sunrise or sunset time.</p>
        <p>If lakes fascinate you, then there's another surprise in the form of Pakhal lake. Just about a distance of 50 kms on the eastern side of Warangal city, this lake beckons you with its serene setting, chirping of migratory birds, and sounds of wild animals. Self drive is again the best way to reach, because of the underdeveloped facility for the last mile connectivity to the Pakhal Lake. Of course, in the well maintained Long Drive Cars, the journey to the interiors of Warangal on the way to Pakhal Lake would be mesmerizing to say the least.</p>
        <p>Though the Pakhal Lake is not a natural lake, but an artificial one, nonetheless it is built on a small tributary of the Krishna River, so its sight is enthralling all the same. Historically it is said to have been made by the Kakatiya ruler, Ganapati Deva, many centuries ago, in the 13th century, to be precise. All around it are hilly terrain and it's nestled well inside a deciduous forest, and spread over an area of about 30 kms. The terrain is picturesque: dotted with rocks, surrounded by forests, enveloped by a misty air and holding a scenic beauty that urbanites long for.</p>
        <p>While Warangal has many more eminent temples and interesting places, if you want to end your trip on a wild note, then there's no better place than Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary. Sited near the Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Telangana states border, Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the oldest sanctuaries of Telangana.</p>
        <p>Self drive comfortably through Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary, and if it's your lucky day you can sight animals such as the sloth bear, sambar, black buck, wolf, tiger, wild dogs, chousingha, chinkara, giant squirrel, four horned antelope, jackal, panther and others. It is also home to many different species of birds. If you are after the creepy and crawly kind, then search for reptiles like the python, kraits monitor lizard, crocodile (mugger), cobra and star tortoise.</p>
        <p>While coming back from Warangal spare some time for another must visit place - the Jain Temple at Kolanupaka. Also known as Kulpakji, this temple is 2000 years old, located in Kolanupaka at a distance of 83 kms from Warangal, on the way to Hyderabad. Yet another reason to self drive!</p>
        <p>No ordinary place, the Jain Temple of Kolanupaka is supposed to be built in 11th Century AD by Bharata Chakravarty of the Rahtrakutas. Recently restored, this temple is regarded to be sacred for the Shwetambaras and is reasonably well maintained by the community. The temple is home to the idols of the three main Jain Tirthankaras : Lord Rishabha, Lord Neminath and Lord Mahavira . The idol of Lord Rishabha is made from a single jade (thus the magnificence it reflects) and is also known as Maniyaswami. If you are the one who goes into great details, then you can find a myriad of Jain manuscripts, antiquities and inscriptions here, proving that that this temple was once a major religious hub for the Jains.</p>
        <p>On the road again, you would notice that the last couple of hours on the way back to Hyderabad are quite scenic.</p>
        <p className='text-lg font-bold py-2 lg:py-4'>Feel comfortable in the quality self driven cars of Long Drive Cars, always</p>
        <p>While you and your family/friends would feel comfortable in the quality self driven cars offered by Long Drive Cars, however, it is worth noting that Warangal is a less visited tourist spot during the summer season when the sun is blazing, the weather is hot and a bit unpleasant.</p>
