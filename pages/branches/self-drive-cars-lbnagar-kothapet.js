      <p>It's hard to believe but the car rental segment in India in the year 2019 looked refreshingly different compared to what it appears today.</p>
      <p>The self driving enthusiasts in India were just beginning to enjoy the possibilities and advantages of self-driving car rental.

This scenario made it a lot easier and fun to search for and drive rental cars. And then came the lockdown and halted it all.</p>
      <p>Another good news is that local and international travel is returning back to normal, and the car rental industry is seeing encouraging signs of recovery. Even though there were a few hiccups along the way, including a worldwide shortage of available rental vehicles, car rentals have emerged as the flag bearers of travel, individual mobility solutions and tourism in a post pandemic India.</p>
      <p className='font-bold text-lg py-2 lg:py-4'>Get self drive cars for rental service in Dilsukhnagar</p>
      <p>Thanks to a company like Long Drive, you can choose from dozens of car models for self drive cars for rental service in Dilsukhnagar. The rental process too is now enormously easier, availability is not an issue at all. While the modern-day urbanites are always enthusiastic about cars, the idea of owning one doesn't excite many of them. The key reason being the services of reliable car rental companies like Long Drive. And also, the new generation smartly believes that buying a car is more of a liability and not an easy asset, owing to the expenditure involved in upkeep or maintenance, insurance fee and depreciation.</p>
      <p>And if your profession involves changing cities, then moving your own car to a different state needs additional expenses on NOC, re-registration and other related expenses. Moreover, there is no single car that comes handy in all situations. A small car is not suitable when going on long drives on uneven roads accompanied by lots of friends. On the other hand, large cars are expensive and not easily manageable on narrow, congested roads and so on.</p>
      <p>Another aspect that goes in the favour of renting a car than owning it - with rapidly changing technology, cars get outdated faster than you can imagine. The latest features of a new car today get obsolete in a matter of some years, or worse, they become too common. While you can always wish to own trending models, the prospect of selling and upgrading every few years is not viable at all and not at all pocket friendly!</p>
      <p>Also consider that for most of the urbanites, the usage too is quite limited. Either the use of owned car is only for weekends, or very occasional use. A lot of officegoers acknowledge that daily office commute is better done on a two wheeler or public transportation like metro or bus. In any large city, it's a given that cars take more time in office or peak hours.</p>

      <p>If you are new to the concept of self drive cars per day, then you would be happy to note that a lot of things have changed for the better in the last few years.</p>
      <p>While a decade or two ago, it was hard to self drive a rented car, today, through a quality company like Long Drive, the idea of self-drive has caught on. Now you can rent a choice of your car without a driver, and for as long as you want.</p>
      <p>The comfort of self-drive as an option has clicked with people of all ages and preferences. Even ladies in India are now well aware of this facility and do not hesitate in trying it out. Many smart individuals have understood the value proposition - of not needing to invest excessively in owning a car, and instead easily manage with self drive cars per day in Dilsukhnagar.</p>
      <p>At a community or society level, this is beneficial as each self-drive car holds the possibility of keeping scores of pre-owned cars off the road.

      <p>Long Drive as a forward thinking car rental company acknowledges the need to embrace change, rather than resist it. The company utilises all opportunities possible to optimally service the changing needs of modern customers, from quick service to offering a seamless rental process.</p>
      <p>No empty tank: While most rental companies claim to provide full tank, but in essence, they give the car with empty or less quantity of fuel.

So the team leaves nothing that can cause disputes, and hence the customers come back for more.</p>
      <p>No lower-end or cheap variants: Other rental agencies generally do not reveal the lower end variant of the car they are giving to the customers. The reason being, most of the time cheaper models are obtained to spend less on investment. While it turns out as cost saving for the company, however, this results in less safety, poor entertainment options and less comfort features in the car, which invariably spoils the customers' experience. At Long Drive cars, mostly the top end or mid variants are bought, and for those customers who want self driving cars for a shorter period then the variant/model is clearly declared at the time of booking, well before commencement of the journey.</p>
